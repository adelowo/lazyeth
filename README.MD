## Lazy eth

A crypto wallet but solely on the command line. 

### Why?

I spend a lot of time on the command line and use Safari solely for surfing the internet. Most times, I want
to perform relatively simple tasks like sending cypto, generating a burner wallet address or just view my token
balances.

My options are to open the explorer or fire up Chrome and load up Rabby to check. OR just open up [Frame](https://frame.sh).

> These are brilliant tools by the way
